# Chaffinch

Chaffinch is a text editor written in Elixir using the [Ratatouille](https://github.com/ndreynolds/ratatouille) toolkit.
The project is basically a learning exercise for me to get to know Elixir as I really enjoy Phoenix.
I do not in any way claim that this code is in any way idiomatic or well thought out, but I hope it might become so.
If you would like to correct my butchering of Elixir, hit me up with a PR or message. I'm eager to learn!

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic text editing in frame
- [ ] Status and message bars
- [ ] X/Y scrolling 
- [ ] File I/O
- [ ] More advanced controls, user configurations
- [ ] Menus/tabs ?
- [ ] Syntax highlighting

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `chaffinch` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
