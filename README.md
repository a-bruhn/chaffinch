# Chaffinch

Chaffinch is a text editor written in Elixir. "Why would you do such a thing?", you might ask.
Great question! This is basically a learning exercise for me to get to know Elixir as I really enjoy Phoenix.
I do not in any way claim that this code is in any way idiomatic or well thought out, but I hope it might become so.
If you would like to correct my butchering of Elixir, hit me up with a PR or message. I'm eager to learn!

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic text editing in frame
- [ ] Status and message bars
- [ ] X/Y scrolling
