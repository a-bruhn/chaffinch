# Chaffinch

Chaffinch is a text editor written in Elixir using the [Ratatouille](https://github.com/ndreynolds/ratatouille) toolkit.
At the moment, the project is basically a learning exercise for me to get comfortable with Elixir.
I do not in any way claim that this code is in any way idiomatic or well thought out, but I hope it might become so.

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic text editing in frame
- [ ] Status and message bars
  - [x] Basic control shortcuts
  - [ ] File name and status at the top
- [ ] X/Y scrolling with scrollbars
- [ ] File I/O
  - [ ] Loading a file with command line arguments
  - [ ] Saving the current state
  - [ ] Prompt when trying to close in a dirty state
- [ ] More advanced controls, user configurations
- [ ] Menus/tabs ?
- [ ] Syntax highlighting
